      <p>It is extremely important to keep your participants identity a secret unless they give you explicit permision otherwise.</p>
      <p>This goes beyond the participants name. For instance, say we are interviewing the owner of a local diner. We might
        want to exclude his or her professional title and identifying factors of the diner. This is becuase someone might
        be able to put the puzzle pieces together and discover the owner's identity </p>

      <h5>Confidentiality</h5>
      <p>Confidentiality is when only you and researchers involved in the project know the identity of the participant</p>
      <p>However, no reading your research report will be able to figure out the identity of your participants</p>
      <p>This is typical in research methods like interviews, when you are engaguing the participant</p>

      <h5>Annonimity</h5>
      <p>Annonimity occurs when <i>no one</i> knows the identity of the participant, not even the researcher or those involved
        in conducting the project</p>
      <p>This is typical in research methods like surveys, which can be sent out by mail or done annonimously online</p>

      <h4>What If I Want To Give Their Name?</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>If you do want to reference the identity of your participant's, you <i>must</i> get their permission first. We recomend
        getting them to sign a release only after you're sure they understand they're agreeing to expose their identity</p>
      <p>Take note, however, your participant might not give you certain information knowing their identity is not going to
        be kept secret</p>
