      <p>Note: We'll give you suggestions for each question, but remember each project is unique, and the flow that works best for you might be very different.  For instance, we suggest you make the first question a soft question, however, you might want to make your first question a hard-hitting if it fits your purposes better.  This is absolutely okay!  Try not to only think about questions individually, but the flow of question as well.</p>
