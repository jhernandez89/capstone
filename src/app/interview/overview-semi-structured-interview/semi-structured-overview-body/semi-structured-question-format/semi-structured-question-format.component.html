<h3>Semi-structured Interviews</h3>

  <hr class="titleLine">
  <p>Creating interview questions might seem like a big deal, but the way you format your questions can greatly influence the
    responses you get back from your participants</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Let us pretend we are studying the experience of college students in their senior year. What might our questions look like?
    Let us first compare different methods for creating questions</p>

          <p class="smallP">Throughout the interview you probably want to avoid giving your opinion on topics. This will likely change your
            participants responses becuase they might feel judged or they might attempt to think of the topic from your prespective

              <h5><span class="red">Bad question:</span></h5>
              <h5>"A lot of people think senior year is the hardest year of college. How do you feel about it?"</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <h5><span class="blueTwo">Explanation:</span></h5>
              <p>In research this is considered a leading question. By telling the participant how others feel about senior
                year we have already framed the question for the particant (meaning we might have influenced the way they
                respond). If we wanted the participants unbiased opinion, it would be better to ask the question in a way
                which would allow the participant to frame the question themselves
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <h5><span class="blueTwo">Better question:</span></h5>
              <h5>"How would you compare your senior year to your previous years in college?</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <h5><span class="blueTwo">Explanation:</span></h5>
              <p>By wording the question this way, we have not talked about senior year being better or worse than previous
                years, allowing the participant more freedom to explore the question
              </p>

            <div class="col-sm-12">
              <h6><span class="blueTwo">NOTE: </span></h6>
              <p>It is okay to ask about positive and negative experiences if that is what we want to know. For instance, we
                might ask a participant what they are enjoying about a senior. It is important to note that this question
                will then not represent how the participant generally feels about their senior year, but is framed in the
                context of what they are enjoying</p>
              <p>We might ask what they are enjoying about their senior year after asking them how they generally are feeling
                about senior year. This way, they will have already framed the question what it is like being a senior themselves</p>

              <p>While we sometimes might want to format questions like this, we also want to try and stay away from "yes" or
                "no" questions. This is because we can ask the question in a way which might yield a richer response from
                our particant

              <h5><span class="blueTwo">Explanation:</span></h5>
              <p>Asking the question like this allows the participant a larger range of responses. We are more likely to receive
                a much more robust answer than if we worded the question as we did in the above example</p>

              <p>We have framed the question in terms of what the participant likes about their classes, but we have not suggested
                that classes or either good or bad</p>
              <p>if we rephrased the <span class="redNoSize">(potentially) bad question</span> in this example as
