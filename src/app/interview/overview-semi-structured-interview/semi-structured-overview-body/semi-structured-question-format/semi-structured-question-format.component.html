                      how others feel about senior year we have already framed the question
                      for the particant (meaning we might have influenced the way they respond). If we wanted the participants
                      unbiased opinion, it would be better to ask the question in a way which would allow the participant
                      to frame the question themselves

                    <p>It is okay to ask about positive and negative experiences if that is what we want to know. For instance,
                      we might ask a participant what they are enjoying about a senior. It is important to note that this
                      question will then not represent how the participant generally feels about their senior year,
                      but is
                      framed in the context of what they are enjoying</p>
