          <p>It is okay to ask about positive and negative experiences if that is what we want to know. For instance, we might
            ask a participant what they are enjoying about a senior. It is important to note that this question will then
            <span class="red">NOT</span> represent how the participant generally feels about their senior year, but is
            <span class="purple">framed</span> in the context of what they are enjoying</p>
          <p>We might ask what they are enjoying about their senior year <span class="blueTwo">after</span> asking them how
            they generally are feeling about senior year. This way, they will have already <span class="blueTwo">framed</span> the question
