        <p>Interviews are typically one-on-one conversations between the researcher and the participant. These can range from
          very casual conversations (unstrutured) to very rigid coversations (structured) and somewhere in-between (semi-structured).

        <p>Interviews are especially good when you want to explore a participant's experience. While a survey might have multiple
          choice questions with rigid answers, interviews can dive into the participant's experiences and find out "why"</p>
        <p>For instance, we might conduct a survey which tells us that 80% of the population support politian A over politican
          B.
        </p>
        <p>The problem is, we might not have a very good idea of <i>why</i> they prefer politician A to policitan B.</p>
        <p>This is where interiews come in. We can select 10-12 people who support politician A, and ask them why they prefer
          that polician over the other</p>

        <p>Ethnography is the act of oberving a culture.  This used to apply primarily to larger groups of people such as entire cultures, but has since been extended to smaller cultures of people such as patreons in coffee shops, work environments, or even a monthly baseball game between friends</p>
        <p>Ethnography is about observing people in their natural environment.  This is useful when you want to study the dynamic of interactions within groups of people.  </p>
